# elope

ELOPE was an open competition organised by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team, the University of Adelaide and TU Delft, that challenged participants to apply event-based vision and estimation algorithms to a realistic lunar landing scenario. In so doing, it aimed to advance navigation methods for future space exploration missions.

The approach in this repo is a PoC, and more of an interesting DL-centric approach than a serious submission to said competition.

## Running the code

The code uses `python 3.13`. To run it, do the following:

1. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment (`python3.13 -m venv .venv`);
2. Install the project in editable mode (i.e., `pip install -e .`);
3. Run the `run_idea.py` script with the idea desired.
