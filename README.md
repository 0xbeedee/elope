# elope

ELOPE is a cutting-edge, open competition organised by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team, the Univeresity of Adelaide and TU Delft, that challenges participants to apply event-based vision and estimation algorithms to a realistic lunar landing scenario. By leveraging simulated event camera data, the competition aims to advance navigation methods for future space exploration missions.

## Running the code

The code uses `python 3.13`. To run it, do the following:

1. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment (`python3.13 -m venv .`);
2. Install all the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`);
3. Install the project in editable mode (i.e., `pip install -e .`);
4. Run the `run_idea.py` script with the idea desired.
